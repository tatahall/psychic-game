# psychic-game


* The purpose of this project is to use javascript to create a guessing game.

* The computer should randomly pick a letter.  The user should enter a letter.
  The game compares the computer's pick and the user's pick.  If they match, the user wins.
  If they don't match, the user is allowed to pick again until remaining guesses equals 0.
  At this point, the number of losses increases.

* The project was used for beginner use of native javascript.

* The game will be maintained by Tahnee Hall.

* Help with the game can be found:
